"""
When somebody requests a page from your website – say, “/polls/34/”, 
Django will load the mysite.urls Python module because it’s pointed to 
by the ROOT_URLCONF setting. It finds the variable named urlpatterns and 
traverses the patterns in order. After finding the match at 'polls/', it 
strips off the matching text ("polls/") and sends the remaining text – "34/" – 
to the ‘polls.urls’ URLconf for further processing. There it matches 
'<int:question_id>/', resulting in a call to the detail() view like so:
detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, question_id=34)
